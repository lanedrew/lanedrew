## Bio

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Colorado State University (defense anticipated Summer 2025), where my research focuses on developing statistical methods for ecological and environmental applications. I have experience working with spatial point processes, record linkage modeling, and statistical computing, with applications ranging from tree demography to social geography. I am passionate about statistical consulting and collaborating on interdisciplinary projects that require advanced data analysis and modeling.

## Research Interests

My research is centered on statistical methods for analyzing complex spatial and temporal data, primarily in ecological and environmental settings. I am particularly interested in:

-   Bayesian Methods and Non-Linear Regression – Implementing Bayesian hierarchical models and non-linear regression techniques for parameter estimation with robust uncertainty quantification.

-   Record Linkage and Data Integration – Developing probabilistic methods for linking spatio-temporal datasets across different resolutions and time points.

-   Spatial and Spatio-temporal Point Processes – Developing models for event occurrences in space and time, with applications to location-dependent marked point processes arising in forestry.

I am always looking for opportunities to apply statistical modeling to real-world challenges and collaborate with researchers across disciplines.
