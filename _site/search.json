I am particularly interested in:\n\nBayesian Methods and Non-Linear Regression – Implementing Bayesian hierarchical models and non-linear regression techniques for parameter estimation with robust uncertainty quantification.\nRecord Linkage and Data Integration – Developing probabilistic methods for linking spatio-temporal datasets across different resolutions and time points.\nSpatial and Spatio-temporal Point Processes – Developing models for event occurrences in space and time, with applications to location-dependent marked point processes arising in forestry.\n\nI am always looking for opportunities to apply statistical modeling to real-world challenges and collaborate with researchers across disciplines."
